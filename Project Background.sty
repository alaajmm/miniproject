Project Background

The background of my mini project is to create an application that manages operations for a coffee store. This includes a main menu, a products list, a orders list and a courier list. These can all be viewed, updated or appended to able to remove items.

Client requirements
1) User is able to access main menu.
2) Can access orders, couriers and product list.
3) User can view, append or remove these lists.
4) User can exit the program.
5) Data persistance used through csv files to ensure data can be ammended and information is not lost.

How to run the app
1) Open integrated terminal
2) Input py miniproject.py and enter
3) Input your option via the main menu

Project reflections
My design I feel is easy for the user to use and maintain, ensuring a smooth process especially during busy periods. It carries out all necessary functions in a simple and user-friendly way.

I gauranteed the project's requirements by checking my code after any changes to ensure any errors were corrected. Not only did I through each function of the code to make sure everything works as it should, I also made sure to read the requirements I needed to meet before implementing any code. Lastly, through the use of CSV files, lists and dictionaries, data was stored in a useful way (data could be modified as need be).

If I had more time, I would have focused on using MYSQL database as it is more scalable and can be useful for the user. Pricing is another thing that I would have implemented in the product/menu list so that more information is availabe for the user.

Throughout this, I most enjoyed using functions to allow for a better code and it helped me organise my code a lot better. Each function had a role, and it allowed me to gain a clearer understanding of my indentations, the break function and if/else statements. For these reasons, I found this project to be extremely useful and
